## AMAZON VINE ANALYSIS

# Overview
In this analysis we did a breakdown of Amazon Vine Reviews where companies could get vine members to submit reviews.  In this analysis the breakdown was of the video game data set.  The first portion of this multiple tables about the data.  The first was a customers table that provided their unique ID along with the count of reviews they provided.  The next was a products table to simply give a product ID # along with the Product Title.  The Review_ID dataframe provided a talbe that provided the relationship between the review_id, customer_id, product_id, product_parent and review_date so this could be relationaly analyzed with other dataframes.  Lastly the vine_table provided a review_id with star_raint, helpful_votes and a few other columns that will be helpful in breaking down helpful reviews on products.  These tables helpd provide a basis to get dataframes that would give us feedback on helpful votes from vine users.  


# Results
From the results we see that the number of five star vine reviews is about 51% and the percent of 5 star no vine reviews is 38%.  This shows that vine users provide more 5 star reviews but would be up to the company if that difference is worth paying vine users for.  


# Summary
Though these numbers provide feedback on the vine review program it would require further discussion with leadership to see if the vine review program is beneficial to a growing company vs when a company is more established.
